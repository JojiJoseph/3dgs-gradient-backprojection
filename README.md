## Setup

Please install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Download `lseg_minimal_e200.ckpt` from https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jkrishna_mit_edu/EVlP4Ggf3OlMgDACHNVYuIYBZ4JNi5nJCQA1kXM-_nrB3w?e=XnPT39 and place it in the `./checkpoints` folder. 

Other than that, it's a self-contained repo. Please feel free to raise an issue if you face any problems while running the code.

## Demo

Left: Original rendering, Mid: Extraction, Right: Deletion

Sample data (garden) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEPby9zWgG40dJ4eRiHu15Jdg7FgvTdG/view?usp=sharing). Please create a folder named `data` on root folder and extract the contents of zip file to that folder.

**Backprojection**

To backproject the features run 

```bash
python backproject.py --help
```

**Segmentation**

Once backprojection is completed, run the following to see the segmenation results.

```bash
python segment.py --help
```


Trained Mip-NeRF 360 Gaussian splat models (using [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat) with data factor = 4) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZCTgAE6vZOeUBdR3qPXdSPY01QQBHxeO/view?usp=sharing). Extract them to `data` folder.


**Application - Click and Segment**



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f1c797f-db29-416f-8917-9be7885231b5



```bash
python click_and_segment.py
```

Click left button to select positive visual prompts and middle button to select negative visual prompts. `ctrl+lbutton` and `ctrl+mbutton` to remove selected prompts.

**Application - Editing with LLM**

```bash
python viewer_with_llm.py --checkpoint data/garden/ckpts/ckpt_29999_rank0.pt --data-dir data/garden  --lseg-checkpoint results/garden/features_lseg.pt
```

Press ` to start prompting. At present it supports only single query at a time. Queries can be of changing view, segment and change color.
